 File Upload and Storage System : Create a file upload system that stores files in Azure Blob Storage

# File Upload and Storage System
## Overview
The File Upload and Storage System is a web application designed to allow users to securely upload files and store them in Azure Blob Storage. This system provides an easy and efficient way to handle file uploads while leveraging the scalability, security, and reliability of Azure Blob Storage.

# Features
Secure File Upload: Users can upload files of various types and sizes.
Azure Blob Storage Integration: Uploaded files are stored directly in Azure Blob Storage for reliable and scalable file management.
File Management: Allows users to view and download their uploaded files.
User Authentication: Provides secure access with basic user authentication.
Error Handling: Ensures smooth user experience with proper error handling and feedback.

# Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following:

Azure Subscription: You'll need an Azure account to create and configure Azure Blob Storage.
Azure Blob Storage Account: Create an Azure Blob Storage account and get the connection string.
Node.js (or appropriate backend environment): The project requires Node.js (or your chosen backend platform) for running the server.
Required Libraries/Frameworks:
Azure SDK for Blob Storage (@azure/storage-blob)
Express (or your preferred framework)
Any additional dependencies specified in package.json
